Tagging and getting extended document informations on ownCloud

Please read the project's wiki at https://github.com/fpiraneo/oclife/wiki .

In case the plugin folder (this README.md file is in) is not named "oclife" you need to rename it to "oclife". Otherwise you won't be able to activate the plugin in your owncloud installation.
